My very first college project, in which all of the students had to redesign a butcher shop site, found at https://deliciasdacarn8.wixsite.com/meusite, with pure HTML, CSS and JS (no frameworks allowed). While I didn't have ANY previous programming knowledge nor any design training, it wasn't hard to realize that there was a LOT going on in there. Starting with a fixed banner that took up at least 1/3 of the viewer's height.

- For starters, I had to pick a color palette, so I went with a mix of black, white, burgundy and gold in order to bring a bit of a regal look to the brand considering it sells a lot of exotic meat. 
However, at the same time, it IS a butcher shop's site, so I also picked a font that looked rough, honoring the shop nature's ambience.

- Then I chose to place a big banner right at the top so I could entice potential clients into buying some juicy meat, and right under that there's a sorting display in which the viewer can see all of the different meat categories (red meat, poultry, fish and exotic).

- At last, it was required of us to create a form so that visitors could send us messages. Again, we weren't allowed to use frameworks and, for some reason that still eludes me, we weren't allowed to use some native input HTML types (such as the radio button), which means I had to simulate the primitive elements using a combination of divs and JavaScript logic. Form validation was also made both by HTML and JS.

However, at that point I didn't know much about responsivity, so unfortunately the site was made completely static.

# To-Do List:
- [ ] Add responsivity using React
